# OpenEarthMap
Quick start in OpenEarthMap  -->
The main features of this library are:

 - High level API (just two lines to create a neural network)
 - 9 models architectures for binary and multi class segmentation (including legendary Unet)
 - 119 available encoders (and 400+ encoders from [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models))
 - All encoders have pre-trained weights for faster and better convergence
 - Popular metrics and losses for training routines
